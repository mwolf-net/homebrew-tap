  caveats <<~EOS
    MouseLock isn't notarized by Apple, so macOS blocks its first launch.
    Open it once, click Done, then go to System Settings -> Privacy & Security
    and click "Open Anyway". Homebrew keeps that approval for future upgrades.

    On first lock, allow MouseLock under Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.
